## What does {{project-name}}?

In short, {{project-name}} solves the problem of ...

## Quick Start

### Install

To install the {{project-name}}, you just need to run

```bash
cargo install --force {{crate_name}}
```

(--force just makes it update to the latest `{{crate_name}}` if it's already installed)

_Note_ the binary is called `{{crate_name | split: "-cli" | first}}` (without `-cli`)

to verify if the installation was successful, you can run `which {{crate_name | split: "-cli" | first}}` that should output similar to

```sh
$HOME/.cargo/bin/{{crate_name | split: "-cli" | first}}
```

### Usage

```sh
$ {{crate_name | split: "-cli" | first}} --help
